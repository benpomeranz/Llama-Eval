The pre-trained models are evaluated in the standard way by calualting the likelihood of each choice character. For the instruct-aligned models, we use a dialogue prompt (user/assistant) for the shots and ask the model to generate the best choice character as answer.

Macro average: average across categories
Micro average: average across questions

We check from response that either: 
first letter is A/B/C/D, or string contains (A.) or equivalent

Failing categories:

    This can be treated as an evaluation of the model provided Replicate API with Llama-3-8b-instruct, rather than a pure test of Llama-3 itself. Why should these be different? Well, test for yourself at:

        "Question:This question refers to the following information.
        "Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others."
        Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776
        Which of the following "miseries" alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era?

        Choices:
        A.Organized response to Bacon's Rebellion
        B.Federal response to Shays's Rebellion
        C.Federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion
        D.Federal response to Pontiac's Rebellion

        Correct answer: C.

        Question:This question refers to the following information.
        "As our late Conduct at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation & a great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty to lay before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears, to us. . . .
        "If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable Attachment in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend them & an utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more recent Facts. When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter."
        —"Apology of the Paxton Boys" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: "apology" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)
        The sentiments expressed in the explanation above reflect which of the ongoing tensions during the colonial period of American history?

        Choices:
        A.Tensions between British policies and the aspirations of North American colonists.
        B.Tensions between American Indians allied with the French and those allied with the British.
        C.Tensions between freed African Americans and white planters.
        D.Tensions between backcountry settlers and elites within colonial America.

        Correct answer: D.

        Question:This question refers to the following information.
        Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
        We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
        We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
        We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.
        —Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934
        President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to political challenges like that of Senator Long by doing which of the following?

        Choices:
        A.Announcing that he would not run for re-election
        B.Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security
        C.Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor
        D.Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy

        Correct answer: "

However, categories that are confused by 5 shot do well on 1 shot. We train 1 shot on the categories which do not handle 5 shot, and 5 shot on everything else. 

We SAMPLE 1 SHOT FROM EVERY CATEGORY: MISFORMATTED: 1 from security studies, 2 from high school Euro, that is it - everything else formats with an answer A., B., C., or D., in the answer on 1 shot

PLAN:
For all nonproblematic categories, go through and 5 shot test them (make 5 shot helper function), this returns a dictionary from topic->#correct/total, then for all problematic go through and 1 shot test them (similar helper function), record the same information, and then we write all of this info out to 2 json files, then we combine the two dictionaries in a python library and graph em and call it a day

From Meta:  For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library. For details on the methodology see here, but here does not exist.

Based on the historical context, I would choose option D: Gold mining.

The California Gold Rush of 1848-1855 brought a massive influx of immigrants to the United States, particularly from China. This led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which restricted Chinese immigration to the United States.

Gold mining was a significant economic activity in California during the mid-19th century, and it played a crucial role in the California Gold Rush.
